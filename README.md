## For Rotate

I have prepared this for you. The project uses the [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [GlideJs](https://glidejs.com/).

This is the first time I have used Astro and Tailwind. For the carousel I have used GlideJs for the first time.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
